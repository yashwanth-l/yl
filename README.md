**I'm excited about the DevOps field because it allows me to combine my passion for technology & automation with my strong collaboration and problem-solving skills. I've always been drawn to the DevOps philosophy of breaking down silos and improving communication between development and operations teams, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this field.**
